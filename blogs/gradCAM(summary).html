          <h2>Paper Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Paper Title:</strong> Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization (Selvaraju et al., ICCV 2017)
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep neural networks, especially CNNs, excel at vision tasks like classification, detection, captioning, and VQA. However, they often act as black boxes, making it difficult to understand or trust their predictions. Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a general-purpose tool to visually explain decisions made by CNN-based models including classifiers, captioning, and VQA models without changing the model architecture.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>Core Idea and Intuition</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CNNs build up high-level features as you go deeper: early layers detect edges/textures, deeper layers detect object parts and shapes.</li>
            <li>Fully connected layers discard spatial information, but the last convolutional layers retain both spatial and semantic information making them ideal for visualization.</li>
            <li><strong>Key innovation:</strong> Grad-CAM uses the gradient of the class score (e.g., "tiger cat") with respect to the feature maps from the last convolutional layer to assign importance scores to each channel. These are combined to create a heatmap showing where the network focused for its decision.</li>
            <br>
            <li>(Also scroll down to know some key concepts and FAQs so that you understand the below portions better.)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>How Grad-CAM Works: Step-by-Step</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Gradient Computation:</strong> For a target class <em>c</em>, compute the gradient of the output score \( y^c \) with respect to feature maps \( A^k \) in the last conv layer. This shows how much each feature influences the class score.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compute Importance Weights:</strong> Average these gradients spatially to get an importance score for each feature map:
              <br>
              \( \alpha_k^c = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_i \sum_j \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{ij}^k} \)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generate Heatmap:</strong> Multiply each feature map by its importance score, sum them, and apply ReLU:
              <br>
              \( L^{\text{Grad-CAM}}_c = \text{ReLU} \left( \sum_k \alpha_k^c A^k \right) \)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>Why ReLU?</strong> It highlights only the positive influences regions that increase the score for class <em>c</em>.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Generalization & Counterfactual Explanations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Grad-CAM is not limited to class scores in image classification; it can be applied to any differentiable output (e.g., words in captions, VQA answers, policy outputs in RL).</li>
            <li>It is architecture-agnostic and works with CNN+RNN, encoder-decoder, and multimodal models.</li>
            <li>Counterfactuals: By computing Grad-CAM for a different class, you can visualize what the model would need to see more of to choose that class useful for debugging and model introspection.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

            <li>Result: Heatmaps that are both class-discriminative and high-resolution, ideal for visualizing fine details that trigger predictions.</li>

          <h2>Applying Grad-CAM to ACT (Transformer-based Models)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Grad-CAM is designed for CNNs but can be adapted to models like ACT, which use a visual encoder (CNN) + transformer.</li>
            <li>For the visual encoder, apply Grad-CAM directly to the last convolutional layer.</li>
            <li>For the transformer, compute gradients of the output with respect to intermediate token embeddings or attention maps, reshape tokens to a 2D grid, and use the Grad-CAM idea to generate a heatmap.</li>
            <li>Challenges: Transformers lack clear spatial structure, so mapping tokens back to image regions requires care.</li>

          <h2>Beyond Visuals: Textual Explanations</h2>
          <p>
            Grad-CAM can also help generate textual explanations by linking important neurons (identified via Grad-CAM) with predefined "neuron names" (e.g., "This neuron activates for dog faces"), providing human-understandable rationales for model decisions.

          <h2>**FAQ: Feature Maps & Output Scores</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>What is a feature map?</strong><br>
            A feature map is a filtered version of the input image that highlights specific patterns (edges, textures, shapes). Each convolutional layer outputs many such maps, each looking for a different pattern.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is the output score for a target class (y<sup>c</sup>)?</strong><br>
            For a CNN classifier, the output is a set of raw scores (before softmax) for each class. The score for "cat" (y<sup>c</sup>) tells how confident the model is that the image is a cat. Grad-CAM uses the gradient of this score with respect to feature maps to show which parts of the image most influenced the prediction.
