        <h1 class="blog-title">ACT Demystified: Action Chunking with Transformers for Robotic Manipulation</h1>
        <p class="blog-date">Published on July 6, 2025</p>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>Paper Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Paper Title:</strong> Learning Fine-Grained Bimanual Manipulation with Low-Cost Hardware (ACT: Action Chunking with Transformers)
          </p>
          <p>
            ACT is a novel imitation learning algorithm that enables robots to perform complex, precise manipulation tasks using only a small number of human demonstrations. It was developed to address the challenges of fine-grained bimanual manipulation, such as threading a zip tie or opening a condiment cup, using affordable hardware and robust learning techniques[13].
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>Why ACT? The Challenge</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Compounding Errors:</strong> Small mistakes in predicted actions can accumulate, causing the robot to fail at tasks that require precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Markovian Human Behavior:</strong> Human demonstrations often include pauses or correlated actions that are hard for simple policies to model.</li>
            <li><strong>Noisy Demonstrations:</strong> Human data is variable—even for the same task, the way it’s done can change each time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Traditional imitation learning methods struggle with these issues, especially for tasks that need high-frequency, closed-loop control and visual feedback[13].

          <h2>Core Innovations of ACT</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Action Chunking:</strong> Instead of predicting one action at a time, ACT predicts a sequence (chunk) of actions for the next <em>k</em> steps. This reduces the effective task horizon and helps prevent errors from compounding.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Ensembling:</strong> To keep robot motion smooth, ACT averages overlapping action predictions at each timestep, using exponential weights to prioritize recent observations.</li>
            <li><strong>Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE):</strong> ACT models the variability in human demonstrations by learning a distribution over action sequences, making it robust to noisy data.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformer Architecture:</strong> ACT uses transformers to model long-range dependencies in both observations and actions, enabling it to learn complex, coordinated behaviors.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>How ACT Works: Step-by-Step</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Action Chunking:</strong> Given the current observation (images and joint positions), ACT predicts the next <em>k</em> actions (target joint positions for both arms). This chunking reduces the number of decisions the policy must make, making learning easier and more stable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temporal Ensembling:</strong> At every timestep, ACT combines multiple predictions for the same action (from overlapping chunks) using a weighted average. This smooths out the robot’s movements and reduces the impact of prediction errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CVAE Training:</strong> During training, ACT uses a CVAE to encode the variability in human demonstrations. The encoder compresses action sequences and joint data into a latent variable, while the decoder (policy) predicts action sequences conditioned on this variable and the current observation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transformer Backbone:</strong> Both the encoder and decoder use transformer layers to process sequences, allowing the model to capture complex temporal dependencies and coordinate multi-step actions.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Observations include four RGB images (from different camera angles) and joint positions for two robot arms.</li>
            <li>Actions are the target joint positions for both arms over the next <em>k</em> timesteps.</li>
            <li>Images are processed with ResNet18 backbones, and features are combined with joint data and the latent variable before being passed to the transformer.</li>
            <li>Typical chunk size: <strong>k = 100</strong> (i.e., predict 2 seconds of actions at 50Hz).</li>
            <li>Model size: ~80 million parameters; training takes about 5 hours on a single GPU.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="blog-section">
          <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>ACT was tested on 6 real-world and 2 simulated bimanual manipulation tasks, such as opening a cup, threading velcro, and inserting batteries.</li>
            <li>Each task used only 10–20 minutes of human demonstration data (50–100 episodes).</li>
            <li><strong>Success rates:</strong> ACT achieved 80–96% on most real-world tasks, outperforming previous methods by a large margin.</li>
            <li>On challenging tasks like Thread Velcro, perception limitations (e.g., low contrast) reduced success, highlighting areas for future improvement.</li>
